    "## 1.) Searching for Items: Sorting a list before searching for a particular entry saves considerable time.\n",
    "## 2.) Finding Duplicates: Similarly, sorting also makes it easy to quickly sift through lists and find duplicates, improving the quality of data.\n",
    "## 3.) Selecting Items: Sorted lists (such as in ascending or descending orders) are always better precursors for data selection.\n",
